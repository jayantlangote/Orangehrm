		<h1><b>Sri Lanka Crisis Live Updates: Sri Lanka protesters set PM Ranil Wickremesinghe’s house on fire. PM Ranil Wickremesinghe has announced his resignation to make way for an all-party government to take over.

:</b></h1> <br>



		<p>The private residence of Ranil Wickeremesinghe, who resigned as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka Saturday, has been set on fire by the anti-government protesters, news agency AFP reported. Wickremesinghe announced his resignation to make way for an all-party government to take over. “To ensure the continuation of the Government including the safety of all citizens I accept the best recommendation of the Party Leaders today, to make way for an All-Party Government. To facilitate this I will resign as Prime Minister,” he wrote on Twitter.
		
		Earlier in the day, thousands of protesters in Sri Lanka’s commercial capital Colombo broke through police barricades and stormed President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s official residence in one of the largest anti-government marches in the crisis-hit country this year, according to news agency Reuters. This came after reports of the President fleeing his home surfaced, according to news agency AFP. Some protesters, holding Sri Lankan flags and helmets, broke into the president’s residence, video footage from local TV news NewsFirst channel showed.

         The island of 22 million people is struggling under a severe foreign exchange shortage that has limited essential imports of fuel, food and medicine, plunging it into the worst financial turmoil in seven decades. Thousands of people swarmed into Colombo’s government district, shouting slogans against the president and dismantling several police barricades to reach Rajapaksa’s house, a witness was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters. Police fired shots in the air but were unable to stop the angry crowd from surrounding the presidential residence, the witness added.</p> <br>

	<h1>Maharashtra: Cabinet expansion after Ashadhi Ekadashi puja, says CM Eknath Shinde:</b></h1><br>

	<p>Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Saturday said the Cabinet expansion will take place after the annual puja of Lord Vitthal on the occasion of Ashadhi Ekadashi to be held on Sunday. He did not divulge further details but said that the oath-taking ceremony of his Cabinet ministers will be completed before the Monsoon Session starts.

    Currently, Shinde and his deputy Devendra Fadnavis are on a visit to Delhi. The duo met Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday and BJP chief JP Nadda today. They are also scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Reportedly, these meetings are being held to discuss the Cabinet expansion and the formula for dividing Cabinet berths between the BJP and the Shinde camp.

    Speaking at a press conference, Shinde said the Shiv Sena-BJP government should have been formed 2.5 years ago. "Our responsibility has increased. 5 years (the Devendra Fadnavis govt) did a very good job. The work done for the benefit of the farmers and the people was stopped in the middle period. Now, we will take it forward again," he said.

    The Chief Minister also spoke about the OBC reservation and said he has held discussions regarding the same. Following the footsteps of the Maha Vikas Aghadi, he said that his government will not hold elections without OBC reservation. He added that he will discuss with the Election Commission about not holding Nagar Panchayat elections during the rainy season.

    Targetting the Uddhav Thackeray-led faction, Shinde said an attempt is being made to mislead people. "But the people of Mumbai and Maharashtra are wise. They know everything. We will continue our work. No matter what anyone says, it will not affect us," he added.</p> <br>

	<h1>England Cricket Trolls Virat Kohli After Edgbaston Victory, And It Has A Jonny Bairstow Reference:</b></h1><br>

	<p>With a crushing defeat to England in the Edgbaston Test, the Indian cricket team has failed to seize the opportunity to register its fourth Test series win in the country. Jonny Bairstow and Joe Root, who have made chasing tricky targets in Test matches fashionable, put the famed Indian pace attack to sword with imposing hundreds as England recorded their highest ever chase of 378 runs with minimum fuss to level the five-match series 2-2. When England were rattled on the fourth afternoon by stand-in skipper Jasprit Bumrah, the two star batters didn't waver from their game plan. On the fifth day, England needed just under 20 overs to knock off the remaining 119 runs.

    After the win, the England Cricket Twitter posted a cheeky Tweet, trolling Virat Kohli. There are two images placed side by side. The first one is of Kohli with his finger on the lips and Bairstow in the frame. The other one is of Kohli hugging Bairstow after the win.
    The photos tell a story. The third day's proceedings in the Test match got off to a fiery start as Kohli and Bairstow were involved in a feisty exchange. The cameras caught Kohli first walking up to Bairstow signalling him to stand in his crease and the former India skipper was then seen making hand gestures. He was then seen gesturing Bairstow to stay quiet. After England captain Ben Stokes was then seen having a word with Kohli, the star India batter approached Bairstow with a big smile and gave him what looked like a friendly punch on the arm.

     All those mind games, however, did not have any impact on Bairstow as he switched gears and hit 106 in the first innings and then an unbeaten 114 in the second to power England to a historic win.</p> <br>

			<p>Growing power of digital footprint in placements</p></h1><br>

			<p> Campus recruitment is the buzzword for any student who joins an engineering college. Admission to an institute is dependent on the campus recruitment index of the institution with many students aspiring for jobs abroad. But with the economic slowdown and impact of Covid-19 campus placements are expected to be affected as well.
            Students can no longer prepare for the campus recruitment process just before placement season and get placed. This changed situation is the time when students need to learn to be self-sufficient and sharpen their skills. It begins with creating an online professional portfolio from the first year itself to increase their chance of getting placed.
            The digital footprint of a student is his/her online identity, which may include performance in the programming platforms, participation in online contests, online certifications, blogs and more. The combination of all these result in a digital footprint of a student, which gives more value than an academic score.

            A typical campus recruitment interview runs for 10 to 30 minutes. The recruiter spends less time in the resume if it is not impressive. Some of the companies shortlist students based on the resume for the initial screening process. In those cases the recruiter spends less than five minutes on the resume. The Digital footprint in the resume makes it easy for the recruiter to shortlist a student if it is an initial process or adds a lot of value during the final selection process.
            A student’s aptitude for self-learning is key here. The hackathons won and online courses taken above and beyond the set curriculum attract more points over the toppers in class. This is because in a job environment theoretical classroom study has its limitations. That is a 7.5-pointer can bag a better package than a 9-pointer student. Similarly, though opportunities for computer science graduates are huge, students from other streams, passionate about programming and undertaking self-learning projects, can catch the eye of companies as well.
            Engineering students should start by building their profile on LinkedIn, the largest online recruitment network. Based on the area of interest, a student may join groups, post about projects and participate in discussions. These channels and groups have various companies who recruit for their domains and a student gets noticed by their contribution in these forums which can help get internships, a step in the doorway. For instance, a student may not be in a top grade institution but their digital presence can make them visible to the biggest of corporates.
            Online certification courses are integral to this digital profile. Coursera, Udemy, Linkedin learning, Skillshare are some of the popular platforms offering online certification courses. It is important that a student complete at least two such courses before attending campus recruitments. Though these courses are not accredited by the industry or institutions it adds diversity. It reflects on the student’s attitude towards learning and shows the person is self-motivated.
            On the practical side, participation in online coding competitions and hackathons come in handy. Enrolling on programming platforms such as HackerRank, HackerEarth, CodeChef, InterviewBit, LeetCode and Geeksfor-Geeks offer sufficient practise for coding, which students of any background can try. Online contests are the other gateway for internships as many companies keep an eye on potential candidates through these. Some of the popular contests include Google’s Code Jam, ACM-IPC International Collegiate programming contest, CodeChef, Microsoft Imagine cup, Topcoder, HP CodeWars, Codeforces, TCS’ Codevita and Infosys’ HackWith-Infy. By participating in these contests, even if a student doesn’t win, the digital footprint improves.
            Student blogs can be the place where all their theoretial and practical knowledge can be put together. Blogs are different from other online activities as they allow students to reflect and put into perspective all that they learned. An insight which give recruiters an understanding of a students analytical thought process. A crucial skill in the world of coding.
            The Covid-19 lockdown is an opportunity for any student to build on his/her digital footprint as they have more time and less academic pressure now. Today, a good score is essential, but a digital footprint adds more value to the CV.</p> <br>
